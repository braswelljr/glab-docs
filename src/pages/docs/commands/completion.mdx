# glab completion

Generate shell completion scripts

## Synopsis

Generate shell completion scripts for glab commands.

The output of this command will be computer code and is meant to be saved to a
file or immediately evaluated by an interactive shell.

For example, for bash you could add this to your '~/.bash_profile':

eval "$(glab completion -s bash)"

When installing glab through a package manager, however, it's possible that
no additional shell configuration is necessary to gain completion support.
For Homebrew, see [https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion](https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion)

```bash
glab completion [flags]
```

## Options

```bash
  -s, --shell string   Shell type: {bash|zsh|fish|powershell} (default "bash")
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```bash
  --help   Show help for command
```
