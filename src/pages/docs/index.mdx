# INTRODUCTION

** GLab ** is an open source `GitLab CLI Tool` written in `Go(Golang)` to seamlessly work with GitLab from the command line. Work with issues, merge requests, watch running pipelines directly from your CLI among other features. Inspired by `gh`, the [official GitHub CLI tool](https://github.com/cli/cli).

`glab` is available for repositories hosted on GitLab.com and self-hosted GitLab Instances. `glab` supports multiple authenticated GitLab instances and automatically detects the authenticated hostname from the remotes available in the working git directory.

## Usage
```bash
glab <command> <subcommand> [flags]
```

## Core Commands

- `glab mr [list, create, reopen, delete, ..]`
- `glab issue [list, create, close, reopen, delete, ...]`
- `glab pipeline [list, delete, ci status, ci view, ...]`
- `glab release`
- `glab repo`
- `glab label`
- `glab alias`

## Examples

```bash
$ glab auth login --stdin < token.txt
$ glab issue list
$ glab mr for 123   # Create merge request for issue 123
$ glab mr checkout 243
$ glab pipeline ci view
$ glab mr view
$ glab mr approve
$ glab mr merge
```
