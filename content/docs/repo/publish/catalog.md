[EXPERIMENTAL] Publishes CI/CD components to the catalog.

## Synopsis

[EXPERIMENTAL] Publishes CI/CD components in the project to the CI/CD catalog using the provided tag name.

Requires the feature flag `ci_release_cli_catalog_publish_option` to be enabled
for this project in your GitLab instance.

Requires the same user as the release author.

- It retrieves components from the current repository by searching for
  `yml` files within the "templates" directory and its subdirectories.
- It fails if the feature flag `ci_release_cli_catalog_publish_option`
  is not enabled for this project in your GitLab instance.

Components can be defined:

- In single files ending in `.yml` for each component, like `templates/secret-detection.yml`.
- In subdirectories containing `template.yml` files as entry points,
  for components that bundle together multiple related files. For example,
  `templates/secret-detection/template.yml`.

```bash twoslash title="Terminal"
glab repo publish catalog <tag-name> [flags]
```
