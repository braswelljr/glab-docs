Clone a GitLab repository or project.

## Synopsis

Clone supports these shorthand references:

- repo
- namespace/repo
- org/group/repo
- project ID

```plaintext
glab repo clone <repo> [flags] [<dir>] [-- <gitflags>...]
glab repo clone -g <group> [flags] [<dir>] [-- <gitflags>...]
```

## Examples

```console
# Clones repository into current directory
$ glab repo clone gitlab-org/cli
$ glab repo clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli

# Clones repository into 'mydirectory'
$ glab repo clone gitlab-org/cli mydirectory

# Clones repository 'glab' for current user
$ glab repo clone glab

# Finds the project by the ID provided and clones it
$ glab repo clone 4356677

# Clones all repos in a group
$ glab repo clone -g everyonecancontribute --paginate

# Clones all non-archived repos in a group
$ glab repo clone -g everyonecancontribute --archived=false --paginate

# Clones from a GitLab Self-Managed or GitLab Dedicated instance
