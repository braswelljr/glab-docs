Manage secure files for a project.

## Synopsis

Store up to 100 files for secure use in CI/CD pipelines. Secure files are
stored outside of your project's repository, not in version control.
It is safe to store sensitive information in these files. Both plain text
and binary files are supported, but they must be smaller than 5 MB.

## Options

```bash title="terminal"
  -R, --repo OWNER/REPO   Select another repository. Can use either OWNER/REPO or `GROUP/NAMESPACE/REPO` format. Also accepts full URL or Git URL.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```
