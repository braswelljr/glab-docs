Set an alias for a longer command.

## Synopsis

Declare a word as an alias for a longer command.

Your expansion might include arguments and flags. If your expansion
includes positional placeholders such as `$1` or `$2`, any extra
arguments that follow the invocation of an alias are inserted
appropriately.

Specify `--shell` in your alias to run it through `sh`, a shell
converter. Shell conversion enables you to compose commands with `|`
or redirect with `>`, with these caveats:

- Any extra arguments following the alias are not passed to the
  expanded expression arguments by default.
- You must explicitly accept the arguments using `$1`, `$2`, and so on.
- Use `$@` to accept all arguments.

For Windows users only:

- On Windows, shell aliases are executed with `sh` as installed by
  Git For Windows. If you installed Git in some other way in Windows,
  shell aliases might not work for you.
- Always use quotation marks when defining a command, as in the examples.

```bash twoslash title="Terminal"
glab alias set <alias name> '<command>' [flags]
```

## Examples

```bash twoslash title="Terminal"
glab alias set mrv 'mr view'

glab mrv -w 123

# :-> glab mr view -w 123


glab alias set createissue 'glab create issue --title "$1"'

glab createissue "My Issue" --description "Something is broken."

# :-> glab create issue --title "My Issue" --description "Something is broken."


glab alias set --shell igrep 'glab issue list --assignee="$1" | grep $2'

glab igrep user foo

# :-> glab issue list --assignee="user" | grep "foo"
```

## Options

```bash twoslash title="Terminal"
  -s, --shell   Declare an alias to be passed through a shell interpreter.
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

```bash twoslash title="Terminal"
  -h, --help   Show help for this command.
```
