Generate Git commands from natural language.

## Synopsis

Generate Git commands from natural language using AI assistance.

Describe what you want to do in plain language, and GitLab Duo suggests the
appropriate Git commands. The AI provides both the commands and an explanation.

After you receive the suggested commands, you can execute them directly from
the CLI. You must confirm each command before it runs.

Use this command to:

- Retrieve forgotten Git commands.
- Learn how to accomplish specific Git operations.
- Get guidance on complex Git workflows.
- Reduce context switching during development.

```bash twoslash title="Terminal"
glab duo ask <prompt> [flags]
```

## Examples

glab duo ask list last 10 commit titles

# :-> A list of Git commands to show the titles of the latest 10 commits with an explanation and an option to execute the commands.

# :-> Suggestions for undoing the last commit with explanations of different approaches.
