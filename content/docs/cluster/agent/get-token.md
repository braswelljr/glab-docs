Create and return a k8s_proxy-scoped personal access token to authenticate with a GitLab Agents for Kubernetes.

## Synopsis

Create and return a k8s_proxy-scoped personal access token to authenticate with a GitLab Agents for Kubernetes.

This command creates a personal access token that is valid until the end of the current day.
You might receive an email from your GitLab instance that a new personal access token has been created.

```bash twoslash title="Terminal"
glab cluster agent get-token [flags]
```

## Options

```bash twoslash title="Terminal"
  -a, --agent int                        The numerical Agent ID to connect to.
  -c, --cache-mode string                Mode to use for caching the token. Allowed values: keyring-filesystem-fallback, force-keyring, force-filesystem, no (default "force-keyring")
      --check-revoked                    Check if a cached token is revoked. This requires an API call to GitLab which adds latency every time a cached token is accessed.
      --token-expiry-duration duration   Duration for how long the generated tokens should be valid for. Minimum is 1 day and the effective expiry is always at the end of the day, the time is ignored. (default 24h0m0s)
```
