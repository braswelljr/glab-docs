Sync and submit progress on a stacked diff. (EXPERIMENTAL)

## Synopsis

Sync and submit progress on a stacked diff. This command runs these steps:

1. Optional. If working in a fork, select whether to push to the fork,
   or the upstream repository.
1. Pushes any amended changes to their merge requests.
1. Rebases any changes that happened previously in the stack.
1. Removes any branches that were already merged, or with a closed merge request.

This feature is experimental. It might be broken or removed without any prior notice.
